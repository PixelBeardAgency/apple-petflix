# User Prompts Log

This file contains a record of all user prompts during the Petflix implementation.

## Setup & Phase 1-2

1. "Can you create a full comprehensive plan from the @petflix-prd-2025-11-10.md and save it in the docs folder in a 'plan' sub-folder"

2. "Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself. To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos."

3. "Going forward, can you stop after each phase has been implemented, and only continue when I say. Put this into action after Phase 2 please."

4. "Before we move onto phase 3, can you help me with setting up the supabase project? I have created the project itself, but want help configuring it"

## Troubleshooting Phase 2

5. "@zsh (97-119)" - npm install error with vite-plugin-pwa version compatibility

6. "@zsh (120-129)" - npm install error with non-existent @radix-ui/react-badge package

7. "@zsh (151-183)" - PostCSS config error with ES module syntax

8. "In my brownser at http://localhost:5173/, you are suggesting I should be able to see the UI, however I can't see anything, just a blank white page."

9. "Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module 'http://localhost:5173/src/services/auth.ts?t=1762942512110' doesn't provide an export named: 'SignUpData'"

10. "Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module 'http://localhost:5173/node_modules/.vite/deps/@supabase_supabase-js.js?v=8e0ab36f' doesn't provide an export named: 'User'. Could you check all of the other possible ways this could fail that are similar to that please?"

11. "Profile is currently inaccessible, I can register and am signed in but can't logout. User has been created in the table. If this is expected at this stage, simply reply telling me that, and then we can move on."

12. "Can you please record every past prompt I've given you, and also record this prompt with all future prompts in a file in the docs folder please? Just the prompts in a numbered list."
